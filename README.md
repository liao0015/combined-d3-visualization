# Taxonomy visualization

## Welcome to taxonomy visualization using d3.js

The sample data is directly loaded into the browser from "bio.csv".

### Design and user interaction

```markdown
# Basic user interaction

- wheel scrolling: zoom in and out
- hold and drag: move the graph around
- hover: show numeric data
- click: show enlarged bar chart for comparison
```

Check out the sample page at [Interactive sample page](https://liao0015.github.io/combined-d3-visualization/).
